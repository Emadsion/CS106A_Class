"""
File name: Jedi Vs Inquisitor

it's a game like Angles & Devil game but in Star wars mode

We Want to transfer both the Jedis (J) and the inquisitors(I) to the other side without
being eliminated by the Inquisitors(I).
Rules: if the number of Inquisitors are more than the number of the jedi at either sides
the Inquisitors will eliminate the Jedis and the game will be lost. So you must find a way to transfer both Jedis
and Inquisitors without being eliminated.

Constrains: -You can't move an empty boat you need at least a person to sail it to the other edge
            -You can't add more than 2 persons inside the boat
            -You can't empty an already empty boat

Try to use the least number of boat moves
