# Jedi_Vs_inquisitors
This game is just like an old Flash game named Preists and Demons. The goal is to transfer both the Jedis and the inquisitors
from one riverside to the other riverside by a boat. If the number of The inquisitors is more
than the number of Jedis at any of the sides the game will be lost. You cannot move an Empty boat and cannot add more than two 
persons inside the boat.

Key Instructions:
note: it's case senstive so beware of that 

- Press 'I' to move one Inquisitor inside the boat

- Press 'J' to move one Jedi inside the boat

- Press 'R' to remove a person from the boat

- Press 'Enter' to move the boat to the other side

Try to beat the game with the least boat moves you can make.
